# Hello! ;) I'm **Kauã Rossi** 🤠

## About Me
⌛ I'm 17 and turning 18 in 2025. I've been programming since 2020.

📚 Analysis and Systems Development student at UFC (Federal University of Ceará).

💌 I love software development in general, so I consider myself versatile—I don’t like being dependent on a single technology to solve problems.

⚡ I'm currently looking for a Web Development job, with a focus on Back-end, Java, and Spring Boot.

🎮 On the side, I develop indie games as a passion project. <3

🎹 In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and video games. :D
