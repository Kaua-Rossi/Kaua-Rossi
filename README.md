# Hello! ;) I'm **KauÃ£ Rossi** ðŸ¤ 

## About Me
âŒ› I'm 17 and turning 18 in 2025. I've been programming since 2020.

ðŸ“š Analysis and Systems Development student at UFC (Federal University of CearÃ¡).

ðŸ’Œ I love software development in general, so I consider myself versatileâ€”I donâ€™t like being dependent on a single technology to solve problems.

âš¡ I'm currently studying **C** with **Computer Science** purposes, but I've already programmed in **Java** to train **logic** and **base concepts**, **JavaScript** to give a try **developing in web**, **C#** to make **games** in **unity** and **python** being my **first programming language**.

ðŸŽ® As a side-project, I develop indie games using GML in Gamemaker as a passion hobby. <3

ðŸŽ¹ In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and play video games. :D
