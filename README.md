# Hello! ;) I'm **Kauã Rossi** 🤠

## About Me
⌛ I'm 18. I've been programming since 2020.

📚 System analysis and Development student at UFC (Federal University of Ceará).

💌 I love software development in general, so I consider myself versatile—I don’t like being dependent on a single technology to solve problems.

⚡ I'm currently studying **Python** and **SQL**, but I've already programmed in **C** and **Java** to train **logic** and **base concepts**, **JavaScript** to give a try **developing in web** and **C#** to make **games** in **unity**.

🎮 As a side-project, I develop indie games using GML in Gamemaker as a passion hobby. <3

🎹 In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and play video games. :D
